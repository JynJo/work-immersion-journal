Day 1:
-	It was quite a long wait when we got in our company HUBE, we were waiting for
	our manager to discuss stuffs with out teacher and also introduce us Vince
	as work immersionists. When the manager finally arrives sir Mike introduced
	us, and the manager sir Lenard made us familliar with the place and the co-workers,
	we also added our fingerprints on their check-in check-out machine. First day was
	just full of observation and introduction to what might our tasks be.

Day 2:
-	Day 2 was kinda where we actually started getting the initiative to offer help,
	we look for oppurtunities to help everytime so that we can act as an employee as
	well. It's a very tiring day since its our first full 9-6 schedule because we arrived
	very late on day 1.

Day 3:
-	In Day 3 me in Vince got seperated on our position. He was in sales position while
	I was in technical, a place where they build and repair PC's. The tasks were really hard
	so the other employees must handle it because we might do some mistakes if we were to do it.
	They are really good at troubleshooting PC's, I was shocked that an elderly man can be so literate
	at troubleshooting computers. The owner of the shop later came and we were tasked to clean
	the tables,  the items, and arrange some stocks.

Day 4:
-	Day 4 me in Vince swapped position, I was in sales and Vince was observing other employees
	build a PC in the other room. I got to help the other employees in crimping RJ45 for a customer
	and I was so pressured, it's literally not easy for me to do RJ45 and infront of the customer,
	I only did one with the help of a senior and I asked Vince to help me do the other one. That time 
	my task became testing if the RJ45 is working, and all of them worked except for one but we fixed
	it after. After that, the company got a new stocks of items delivered so we helped to arrange 
	the items on their places. most of the restock this day is monitor, keyboards, printer, headphones,
	and mouse.
